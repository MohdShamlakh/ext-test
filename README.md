Test Repo for All SASS Projects
Welcome to the Test Repo for All SASS Projects! This repository serves as a central hub for quality assurance (QA) practices across our various projects. As we strive for excellence, weâ€™ll leverage the following tools to ensure code quality, type safety, and robust testing.

Quality Assurance Tools
Enforce Code Style and Catch Bugs Early On:
ESLint: Detect and fix errors in JavaScript code.
Prettier: Automatically format code for various languages.
Strict Type Safety:
TypeScript: Enhance JavaScript with additional syntax for better editor integration. Catch errors early during development.
Automated Linting and Testing:
Husky: Automatically lint commit messages and code, and run tests upon committing or pushing changes. Works seamlessly with ESLint and Prettier.
Unit Testing:
Jest: A JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness in any codebase. Write tests using an approachable, familiar API. Works well with TypeScript.
End-to-End Testing:
Cypress: Test applications directly in the browser. Debug failures right within the browser (visual testing).
Continuous Performance Monitoring:
Lighthouse CI: Continuously measures application performance and generates reports. Optimize your app for speed and user experience.
Automate Workflows with GitHub Actions:
Build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub. Streamline your software development process.
Collaborative Frontend Deployment:
Cloudflare Pages: Ideal for frontend developers. Collaborate and automatically deploy websites hassle-free.
Availability Monitoring:
Uptime Robot: Monitor website availability, SSL certificates, and domain expiration. Keep your services up and running.
Code Coverage Reporting:
Codecov: Get insights into code coverage. Ensure comprehensive testing across your projects.
Web Security Awareness:
OWASP Top 10: Familiarize yourself with the standard awareness document for developers and web application security.
